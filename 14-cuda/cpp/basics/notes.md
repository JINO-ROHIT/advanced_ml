**how to compile the cpp code**

```cpp
- g++ <filename>.cpp -std=c++20 //using latest version
```

**how to start a new line when printing to console**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // single quoted (by itself) (conventional)
    std::cout << "Yep." << "\n";                 // double quoted (by itself) (unconventional but okay)
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n";     // between double quotes in existing text (conventional)
    return 0;
}
```

**forward declaration** 

this code will not recognize add since its below main. A forward declaration allows us to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier before actually defining the identifier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

### preprocessor

Instead, prior to compilation, each code (.cpp) file goes through a preprocessing phase. In this phase, a program called the preprocessor makes various changes to the text of the code file. The preprocessor does not actually modify the original code files in any way -- rather, all changes made by the preprocessor happen either temporarily in-memory or using temporary files.

When the preprocessor runs, it scans through the code file (from top to bottom), looking for preprocessor directives. Preprocessor directives (often just called directives) are instructions that start with a # symbol and end with a newline (NOT a semicolon). 

### macro defines

The #define directive can be used to create a macro. In C++, a macro is a rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text.


**object like macros**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define MY_NAME "Alex"

int main()
{
    std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n';

    return 0;
}

Which, when run, prints the output My name is: Alex.
```

**conditional compilation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define PRINT_JOE

int main()
{
#ifdef PRINT_JOE
    std::cout << "Joe\n"; // will be compiled since PRINT_JOE is defined
#endif

#ifdef PRINT_BOB
    std::cout << "Bob\n"; // will be excluded since PRINT_BOB is not defined
#endif

    return 0;
}
```

#ifndef is the opposite of #ifdef, in that it allows you to check whether an identifier has NOT been #defined yet.

**header guards**

```cpp
#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
#define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE

// your declarations (and certain types of definitions) here

#endif
```

**pragma once**

#pragma once serves the same purpose as header guards: to avoid a header file from being included multiple times. With traditional header guards, the developer is responsible for guarding the header (by using preprocessor directives #ifndef, #define, and #endif). With #pragma once, weâ€™re requesting that the compiler guard the header.

```cpp
#pragma once

// your code here
```

**sizeof**

```cpp
#include <iomanip> // for std::setw (which sets the width of the subsequent output)
#include <iostream>
#include <climits> // for CHAR_BIT

int main()
{
    std::cout << "A byte is " << CHAR_BIT << " bits\n\n";

    std::cout << std::left; // left justify output

    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "bool:" << sizeof(bool) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "char:" << sizeof(char) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "short:" << sizeof(short) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "int:" << sizeof(int) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "long:" << sizeof(long) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "long long:" << sizeof(long long) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "float:" << sizeof(float) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "double:" << sizeof(double) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << std::setw(16) << "long double:" << sizeof(long double) << " bytes\n";

    return 0;
}

bool:           1 bytes
char:           1 bytes
short:          2 bytes
int:            4 bytes
long:           4 bytes
long long:      8 bytes
float:          4 bytes
double:         8 bytes
long double:    8 bytes
```
