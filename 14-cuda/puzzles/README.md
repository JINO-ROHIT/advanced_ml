### Sasha Rush puzzle list

These puzzles are a re-implementation of the excellent professor, Sasha Rush which was originally written in Python Numba. https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles

I have implemented the puzzles in C++ CUDA as I documented my learning of CUDA along the way.

### How to run

I have added a makefile to make the execution and the cleanup easier. Simply

```bash
make run <filename.cu>
```
