#### 100 days of CUDA Challenge

This is my attempt to write a kernel every day for the next 100 days and document my learning journey.

Mentor : https://github.com/hkproj | https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu

Day1

1. [CheckDeviceInfo](day1/checkDeviceInfo.cu) - a kernel to understand every detail about your GPU present in the system.

Day2

2. - [VectorAdd](day2/sumArray.cu) - a kernel to do vector addition
   - learned how to configure and use nvidia nsight to profile kernels and understand bottlenecks
